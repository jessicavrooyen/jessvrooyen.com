# Food Lover's Market // Case Study

## UI and UX Focused Mobile App and Web Redesign Concept

### Design Brief

**The Company**
Food Lover’s Market, formerly known as “Fruit and Veg” has partnered with many companies such as Market Liquors, Seattle Coffee Company, and Freshstop. Food Lover’s Market re-created the ambiance of an old-fashioned marketplace in a modern theater-of-food setting. 

**Project Objective**
Website redesign with a focus in enhancing the user experience. Integrate a mobile app for online order and delivery of goods. Poster designs for specials. 
**Goals and Expectations**
Create a mobile app that will allow for customers to browse goods online and place an order for delivery. Simplify website 
for enhanced user experience. Poster designs for weekly or monthly specials.

**Strengths**
They have a lot of partnered companies that provide extra services to enhance the customer’s shopping experience. Their existing site provides recipes, news, specials and a store locater. 

**Weaknesses**
The opportunity to take make the shopping experience further is there, but not explored. 

**Competition**
SPAR Supermarket - They provides recipes on their site, have a monthly magazine subscription for specials and news. An “Ask the dietitian” section to provide guidelines for healthy eating. They have community activities such as Women’s Race, Grand Prix Challenge, and Sporting collaborations. Their site is hard to navigate, though and they have no partners that provide extra services such as coffee or local gas station shops like Freshstop.

**Unique Positioning Statement**
Shopping is as much about the experience as it is about the things you buy.

**Brand**
There is an existing website and logo. But revisiting the 
current visuals to match the redesign of the site and app design is encouraged. 

**Audience**
The audience includes anyone that likes to shop at FLM and would like to use an app that lets them order their groceries from the comfort of their own home. Elderly or disabled persons who don’t have access to transport and have difficulty shopping on their own. 

**Behavioral Habits**
They don’t like crowded markets and would rather browse the produce and products at their own leisure. They have a disability that makes it hard to buy their own groceries or they don’t have transport. (There are no public transport options here).

**Project Components**
Redesign of existing website to enhance user experience. Mobile app design for online orders. Revisit brand identity with the addition of posters for weekly/monthly specials.

**Geography**
Intended for users in Polokwane, Limpopo.

**Concept**
Online grocery shopping application with delivery and promotional posters for specials.

**Theme**
Easy to use, fast, secure, and user-friendly.

## Nati expugnacior nympha milia nascuntur amico

Multis timidus hic si auctor hausit. Suos taedasque, malis est nitente sceleri
sunt florem.

Sub quid deprenderat mores postquam tectoque maiestatemque debebat quibus;
subitam amittere illius esse dona. Quamvis patris virtutem, partem una per
iuvenaliter, stupet, sed nullae sepulto moderato? Nec phaedimus aequoris dixit.
Hic bis parenti: e petunt satis.
